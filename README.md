# Nephio

The Nephio project is building a Kubernetes-based automation platform for
deploying and managing highly distributed, interconnected workloads such as 5G
Network Functions, and the underlying infrastructure on which those workloads
depend.

Nephio is very early in its development; there is no release yet. However if you
wish to experiment with the project, please take a look at the [Nephio
POC](https://github.com/nephio-project/nephio-poc) repository.
